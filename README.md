AIM:--
1. We are performing a regression problem, so we will predict the "FWI" value
2. If we were solving a classification problem, then we would have to deal with the "Classess" feature.

About the dataset:--
The dataset has two partitions: Bejaia region and Sidi-Bel Abbes region
The dataset will be converted now into 2 sets based on region from 122 index, and we can make a new column based on the region
"Bejaia Region Dataset".
"Sidi-Bel Abbes Region Dataset"
